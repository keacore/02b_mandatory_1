# Mandatory Assignment 1

This assignment is simple. You should create a Web Application that is build with the basic features in ASP.NET Core, like the one we did at in the first class [#1](htdottps://github.com/keacore/01_code_from_teachings)     

The web application should have **1 html page** that is served at the url http://localhost:5000/index.html.    
The page should look like this:
#

![index.html](/materials/html_mandatory.png)

#


The text on the page can be found in the materials folder in a file called _[exercise_1.txt](/materials/exercise_1.txt)_, and the [image](/materials/html_img.png) on the page can be found in the same folder.

The html file should have an external Style Sheet (CSS) and in that style sheet you should define that the background color of the whole page should be yellow.  

## When you are done, and no later than 23:59 tonight (16/2-2017), you should hand it in by creating a _Pull Request_    
(you can read about pull requests [here](https://github.com/keacore/GitTypicalUseCases/blob/master/pull_request.md))
